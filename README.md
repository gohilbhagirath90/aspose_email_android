This package contains Android Example Projects for [Aspose.Email for Android](http://www.aspose.com/android/email-component.aspx).

Aspose.Email for Android empowers software developers to design Android applications for managing and manipulating email messages without getting lost in the complexities of Microsoft Outlook file format implementation. Its purpose is to manipulate Outlook email file formats from within applications and it has no dependencies other than Android Runtime.

Aspose.Email for Android gives you the tools you need to create, read and manipulate Outlook MSG, PST, EML, EMLX, and MHT files from within an Android application. With Aspose.Email for Android, you can not only change the message body, but also manipulate (add, extract and remove) attachments from a message object. You can customize message headers by adding or removing recipients or changing the subject and other properties. It gives you control over an email message by providing access to its MAPI properties.

Aspose.Email’s iCalendar component makes it possible to create and save Outlook Calendar objects in various formats such as MSG and ICS. You can also read calendar objects using this API.

These example projects provide helpful demonstrations and code when using Aspose.Email for Android. You will need to [download Aspose.Email for Android](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/74/android-components/aspose.email-for-android/default.aspx) separately and it will work in evaluation mode.
